# Simple Bootstrap Website

Bootstrap 4 is a free and open-source CSS framework used for designing mobile first responsive websites. 
I will also be creating a simple website in HTML using Bootstrap 4 framework. The webpage begins with a user-friendly 
landing page that contains a Navigation Bar, a fluid Jumbotron heading, and a gallery of images. 
Bootstrap 4 is a free and open-source CSS framework created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter.  
This framework is specifically directed for creating responsive, front end web designs using CSS (includes SASS, LESS) and 
JavaScript-based design templates. Bootstrap can be added to your HTML in 2 ways. First, by downloading the files and adding them in the
<head,> section of your HTML code as you would with any CSS file. For best performance results, it is best to use the 
minified version bootstrap.min file.  Second, you can add bootstrap through a content delivery network (CDN) that is stored in the cloud. Adding the CND file under the same <head> section of your HTML code allows you to use the framework for efficiently. 
Bootstrap is developed for mobile-first web applications, optimizing the design of a webpage for mobile devices first and then scaling up 
the design using CSS media queries to creates a responsive design for larger screens such as tablets, monitors and large display screens. 
To make sure that proper screen adjustment is met, the viewport meta tag needs to be added to the <head> section of your 
HTML code <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no",>
Creating a simple but responsive page is made easy and fast using Bootstrap. The index.html page is an example of a simple responsive landing page that includes a Navigation Bar, a fluid Jumbotron heading, and a gallery of images.Bootstrap framework can be used to create many web designs that are visually aesthetic 
and user friendly without having to start a webpage from scratch. 

No SEO, as this is a project site.
Contains minified js and css along with regular. Also for the js there must be an easier way than the way I did it Im still learning.
